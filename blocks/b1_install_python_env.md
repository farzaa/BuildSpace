# Set up your system for Python
*Note: These instructions will work for Windows, Linux, and Mac :).*

Before you get coding, you need to install certain tools that don't come with your computer by default.

## VS Code
First, we'll need VS Code. This is a magical piece of software that makes it really easy for you to write and run code. It's pretty much like Notepad but with a lot of fancy features for developers.

Get VS Code here and install it before moving on.

## Python
We're going to be writing some code in Python which is an extremely simple and powerful programming language. In order to actually *run* Python programs we'll need to install Python on our system. You'll see what I mean.

Get and install Python 3.8 from here before moving on.

## Extensions
Now, open up VS Code. 

So, at this point you *could* start writing and running some Python programs. But, I'm going to make you install these things called VS Code Python *extensions*. These are pretty much like little cheat codes that make it even easier to start writing and running Python programs.

In VS Code within the top menu bar where it says stuff like "File" and "Edit" click "View" and then click "Extensions". 

You should see a box that says something like "Search Extensions in Marketplace". Within the box type in *ms-python.python* and click the green "Install" button. You just installed a Python extension. Remember this!

Cool.

TODO: Now we need to make sure VS Code is using the right version of Python. 

## Hello World

Lets make a Python program! Go and click "File" and "New". Save this new file with the name `hello.py`. 

*Note: When you do this, you might see something popup in the bottom right telling you to install something called pylint. Click install. If it asks you, install it with pip*.

Finally, within the `hello.py` file type in 

    print("Hello World")
Then, hit the green play button at the top right. You should see the words "Hello World" printed out within the window near the bottom of the screen :). This is your **terminal**.

If you don't see it, join the Discord right now and mention it in #tech-support. I'll help you.
